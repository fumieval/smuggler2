- [X] cut out unused code

- [ ] check that source is not rewritten if there are no changes

- [ ] testing: check that smuggler really works with different export types

- [ ] does hiding work?

- [ ] Script to generate new test (from template?)

- [ ] get the tests to work by generating correct golden values for different
  combinations of options.
