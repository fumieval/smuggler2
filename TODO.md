# Things to be done

- [ ] does hiding work?

- [ ] does CPP work? (should do)

- [ ] Script to generate new test (from template?)

- [ ] get tasty-golden to delete successful results and update tests where
  smuggler makes no changes

- [ ] refactor the much more sophisticated https://github.com/ddssff/refact-global-hse

- [ ] Do a better job of preserving comments

- [ ] Running test suite on both an imported module and the module that imports
  it creates race conditions because both cases will generate the same minimum
  imprts dump file
